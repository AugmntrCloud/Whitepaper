## The AR Metaverse

Augmntr Studio is developing the AR Metaverse or the AugmntrVrse which is a Tech-Stacked Ecosystem that allows you to turn your NFTs into AI interact-able Sidekicks using Machine Learning. Augment, Expand & Trade your Modulated Intelligence in the AR/AI Trained AugmntrVrse Marketplace.

Imagine always having access to your assistant via Augmented Reality. An assistant is not an avatar with no intrinsic value, but your own NFT stacked with modular intelligence tailored to your needs. AugmntrVrse enables you to evolve your degenerate Apes (or whatever dumb jpeg) into intelligent Sidekicks. We call this Evolution 'Non-Fungible Intelligence' (NGI)

Welcome to your new portal to the AR Metaverse, a new way to experience and interact with your NFTs as you have never experienced before.

The AugmntrVrse Ecosystem consists of 6 Main Pillars:

### AugmntrVrse Dashboard
The dashboard is your build environment where you modulate your sidekick's intelligence. Imagine teaching it a new language in a drag & drop interface. Within the dashboard, you will be able to train your sidekick with specific modules that have been developed by both our internal Teams and Community Builders. These modules can be acquired via AugmntrVrse Marketplace.
 
### AugmntrVrse Marketplace
The marketplace is your portal to discover newly innovated modules that you can drag and drop to your dashboard.
AugmntrVrse Marketplace is designed to bring together community builders and the AugmntrVrse citizen to browse & acquire modular intelligence using the $AST Token. In the process, developers commercialize their efforts by earning $AST for their listed modules. This is key in our pursuit to encourage anyone to build, trade and profit from the modules they have created.
 
### AugmntrVrse - $AST Token
The $AST Token (Augmntr Studio Token) is our Native Currency which fuels the entire economy of our ecosystem. The Utility of $AST is vast and is purposed, but not limited to the following:

➡️ AugmntrVrse Citizen & Community Builders can Exchange $AST Tokens on Marketplace for Modular Intelligence.
➡️ Hackathon & Competition Prizes are earned in $AST
➡️ Community Developer Grants are distributed in $AST
➡️ $AST can be used to trade for our Own & Partner NFT's
➡️ Holders of $AST can participate in DAO Governance meetings
➡️ Request & Pay a Certified AugmntrVrse Developer to build your desired Modules & Sidekick's Intelligence Stack
➡️ Use $AST to purchase AugmntrVrse Merchandise
➡️ Use $AST to Participate & Mint future NFT ecosystem drops.
 
### AugmntrVrse SDK/Academy
All community members will have access to the tools and knowledge-base to create, test and deploy their own custom modules including AI and machine learning libraries.

The SDK environment goes beyond a code interface. Our in-house developers will run a tight AugmntrVrse Academy Channel for the citizen builder to tap into our internal knowledge-base and accelerate development within the ecosystem. In addition, we will conduct regular Hackathons & Competitions to catalyze community growth and development. Our Ecosystem Fund will fuel this growth with grants, giveaways & prizes.
 
### AugmntrVrse Ecosystem Fund
Avaliable to Citizen Builders around the World, our Ecosystem Fund will be the catalyst to hyper-development of Intelligent Modules within the AugmntrVrse Marketplace. It will support existing and future developers in building novel AI Modules using our internal SDK Toolkits and Machine Learning, backed with the $AST Token as the Native Currency for Grants. Applications to these grants will commence in parallel of our Hackathons and within a few months of the Official Platform Launch.
 
### AugmntrVrse DAO Governance
The Augmntr Foundation will operate a DAO Governance for the future of the AugmntrVrse Ecosystem. In line with the Web3 technologies we are building, this initiative is paramount in establishing a truly decentralized system whereby our active community have a collective say and vote on the future of the AugmntrVrse.
