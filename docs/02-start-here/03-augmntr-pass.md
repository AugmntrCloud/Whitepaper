## Augmntr Pass - The Genesis Collection
It all started in 1971 with an aspirational and monumental mission to grow trees on the moon. From the Apollo 14 Mission, 500 seeds from five different species of trees were taken, however, these seeds did not land on the moon and instead orbited around. After being exposed to microgravity along with the alien-like particles in the galaxy, these seeds were returned back to earth to germinate in quarantine and then planted alongside Earthly trees. These unique trees were known as 'Moon Trees.'

The world does not know that some seeds remained in orbit and have mutated and evolved over the last fifty years. With exposure to interstellar dust, planetoids and asteroids, alongside the immensity of the energy provided from the galaxy, these little earthly seeds metamorphosed into variations of absurd, alien-like plants. They resemble features of the currently advancing Metaverse, with luminous mythical characteristics, eerie vibrant colours, and unearthly and eccentric fruition. These MoonTrees are the elements of our unique, environmental NFT masterpieces.

With the fusion of the natural, digital and augmented world, these three realms inspired our pieces of art to be intricately hand illustrated with elements plucked from the evolving world we live in. Appreciating the simplicities of nature, while evolving with the complexities and opportunities the future holds.
