## Value Proposition to Genesis Holders

Augmntr Pass is the Official Genesis NFT Collection of Augmntr Studio’s Ecosystem. All holders of the Augmntr Pass collection are referred to as ‘Genesis Founding Members’ and will have the following privileges as a token of respect for their early support. New Value will be consistently introduced as we reveal more details of our roadmap & ecosystem expansions:

### Guaranteed Allocation across the Ecosystem
Genesis Founding Members will have Guaranteed allocation in the private-sales of all Product & Platform launches under the Augmntr Studio Umbrella, commencing with AugmntrVrse.

### Pre-Launch Access to Premium Modules
Genesis Founding Members get Perpetual Priority access to all Premium Modules within the AugmntrVrse Marketplace. Furthermore, all newly built modules that will be developed by both our Internal Teams and Wider Developer Community will be made available First to our Genesis Founding Members, ahead of their Public listings.

### Pre-Launch Access to AugmntrVrse
Genesis Founding Members will be the first batch to experience AugmntrVrse ahead of its public launch, the World's First AR Portal to the Metaverse.

### Partner Whitelisting & Alpha
Genesis Founding Members will have Preferred Status on all Partner NFT drops, Partner Whitelist allocations, Giveaways, Merchandise Drops & Alpha Insights. This will be managed via Genesis Only Channel within our Discord Server.

### Private Sale Participation in $AiPES Token 
Genesis Founding Members will have Guaranteed participation in the $AGMNTR Token Launch in the Private Sale Round. More details will be revealed post AugmntrVrse Pass Sale.

### VIP Staking Status
Genesis Founding Members are granted VIP Staking Status entitling a Higher Earning-Multiplier Advantage in our $AGMNTR Token Mechanics. More details will be revealed post Augmntr Pass Sale.

### Private Club Room with Co-Founders
We will set up a Genesis Holder Channel in Discord as a commitment to direct and transparent dialogue between Genesis Founding Members & Co-Founders on all topics including feature-requests, regular development updates, ecosystem insights and in-app/platform experience discussions etc.

### Access to Ecosystem Grants
Our Ecosystem Fund & Foundation is a core pillar in our strategy to hyper-growth development. Genesis Founding Members have preferred status in the selection process for available grants and will be favoured in application among the general Public. This will be publicly known to citizen builders to encourage them in acquiring an Augmntr Pass from Secondary Markets.

### Voting Rights in DAO Governance
The DAO Governance is paramount to making critical decisions for the Ecosystem and its direction. Generally, an AugmntrVrse Citizen will require a minimum holding & stake of $AGMNTR Token to earn the right to vote. However, Genesis Founding Members are granted that right by default!

### Genesis is DIAMOND Standard!
Genesis Founding Members will always be branded as the Alpha of Augmntr Studio’s Ecosystem, and forever carry that Prestigious Title. We will consistently introduce new and exclusive value for Genesis Founding Members with the goal of elevating the price-value on Secondary Marketplaces compared to all other collectables within our ecosystem.
