### Olive Tree Project
If there is one thing that encompasses the wholesomeness and enrichment of nutrients in a compact little fruit, it is the olive. The olive tree is not only an ornamental tree that brings you Mediterranean vibes, it offers opportunities to create multiple beneficial products that can make a positive impact on people's health and livelihood.

The olive tree is one of the most economical trees for its ability to provide fruit, oil and wood. In addition, with growing interest in using traditional naturopathic ways to improve our lifestyle, olive oil has been further adopted worldwide to improve health.

At Augmntr Studio, we not only want to allow you to enjoy unique, environmental NFT masterpieces, but we also want you to feel the rewards and satisfaction that come with planting an olive tree. This will help sustain a vulnerable family's livelihood and reap the ongoing blessings of this beautiful, long-lasting Charity. **Therefore, in Partnership with Zaytoun Foundation UK, we have committed to planting an Olive Tree for every Augmntr Pass minted in our Genesis Sale.**

Sustainable living is what we all should be aspiring to achieve. But supporting a family in need is our responsibility, and taking care of our planet is our rent for being allowed to live here. Planting a seed is planting hope, hope for a better future for us all.

### Amazon Forest Rebuild

==“Imagine a man without lungs. Imagine earth without the Amazon rainforest.” ~ Vinita Kinra==

We underestimate the power of each tree and how it allows us to inhale purified air that enables animals and us to survive. We take these simple yet crucial parts of life for granted as we occupy ourselves with the rat race of survival, neglecting our responsibilities to our home, giving us each breath we take.

The Amazon is the world's most extraordinary rainforest, housing 40,000 plant species, 16,000 tree species and 6130 animal species. It's biodiversity is astounding but is being destroyed at exponential rates due to unsustainable agriculture, logging and forest fires. This not only leaves thousands of indigenous people homeless but leads to catastrophic amounts of carbon being released into the atmosphere.

This generation has unfortunately witnessed the exacerbated demolition of the Amazon rainforest. However, we are at a tipping point where we can make a change for a better future with a sound education. At Augmntr Studio, our mission is to create awareness about the significance our actions have on the planet and to create positive change to the environment and our livelihoods one seed at a time. In Partnership with OneTreePlanted Foundation, we will be donating a Tree to the Amazon Rainforest for every Augmntr Pass transacted and exchanged on OpenSea.
