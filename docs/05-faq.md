### Why is it called MoonTrees?
Check out the 🌳｜augmntr-pass for the whole story. It’s inspired by the name given to the Seeds experimented with in the 1971 Apollo 14 Mission.

### What Blockchain Protocol are you building on?
Solana. As an Eco-friendly brand rebuilding the Amazon Rainforest among other environmental charities we believe Solana is no-brainer for our Carbon Footprint. In saying that, we are working towards an interoperable approach for all protocol NFT holders.


### What Marketplaces will MoonTrees be listed in?
Magic Eden, Solanart & OpenSea.


### What are the number of traits in the collection?
Over 150 Hand-Illustrated Traits programmatically re-generated into a collection of 8888 MoonTrees.

### What are the Rarity Levels in the Collection?
MoonTrees, being the Genesis collection, will all share the same privileges and utility equally. There will be approx 35 x 1/1 MoonTree’s that are novel by design ONLY, and share the same utility as the rest. Those 1/1's will be stored in the company reserve and gifted to Honorary Individuals in our pursuit for real-world B2B Partnerships, Special Recruits and Tech-Industry Influencers etc

### What is Augmntr Studio's Commitment to Charity and the Environment?
➡️ In partnership with Zaytoun Foundation UK, an Olive Tree will be Planted for every Genesis MoonTree Minted. That’s 8888 Olive Trees!

➡️ In partnership with OneTreePlanted, a Tree will be planted in the Amazon Rainforest for every MoonTree transacted on the Marketplace. Perpetually!
