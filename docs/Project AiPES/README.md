The future of NFT's

Project Overview
Founded in 2022, Augmntr Studio is a Creative-Tech Web3 Powerhouse incubated in New Zealand, now operating out of Dubai.

Working on the cutting edge of AR / AI & Machine learning technologies, we're developing an Ecosystem of real-world Web3 applications accessible to Degens. Our mission is to Pioneer the World's First AR Portal into the Metaverse (the AugmntrVrse) for the Web3 citizen. We will achieve this by developing the World's First drag & drop platform for Web3 citizens (technically inclined or not) to build a modular AI Sidekick without code!

What more?! We are developing the World's First AI/AR Agent built on Solana.
